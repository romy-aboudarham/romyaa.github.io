1. I successfully made my cs.tufts.edu/~raboud01 link redirect to my github account. I was able to implement all 		necessary files such as an index.html, resume.html, and bio.html. At first, I made separate 	  files for each page. Then I realized that it would be cleaner and more efficient to just use one. 
2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
	Olivia MacDougal and Narimon Farhangi
3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.
	6 hours
4. Be written in either text format (README.txt) or in Markdown (README.md). No other formats will be accepted. Please use all capital letters for README
