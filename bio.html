			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm Romy Aboudarham and I was born and raised in Mountain View, California. Coming from the heart of the Silicon Valley, I was exposed to technology and innovation at a young age. My dad gave me my first camera and desktop computer when I was only 11 and since then my creativity and imagination was unstoppable. On my own, I filmed numerous videos ranging from silly video blogs to elaborate music videos that I made with my friends. I started my own Youtube channel where I gained a small, but supportive following. 
			<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Creating these Youtube videos and getting involved in such an expansive online community played a crucial role through my adolescence. I come from a broken home where I learned many unique and difficult things at a young age from observing my parents and the world around me. My mom came to America from South Africa to pursue her acting career. My father was a software engineer from Algeria who came to America to study Psychology. Although it was tough growing up under a roof where my parents didn’t love each other, I distracted myself from the chaos with my trusty friend, imagination. My mom’s love for the stage led me to clown around with a video camera and my dad’s innovative drive enabled me to take what I created and share it with the public. Throughout my 19 years of growing up at home, I produced, edited, and published an assortment of entertaining and goofy Youtube videos. I am my wacky, creative, and innovative self because I never let anything or anyone stop me from exploring my imagination.
