		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm Romy Aboudarham and I was born and raised in Mountain View, California. Coming from the heart of the Silicon Valley, I was exposed to technology and innovation at a young age. My dad gave me my first camera and desktop computer when I was only 11 and since then my creativity and imagination was unstoppable. On my own, I filmed numerous videos ranging from silly video blogs to elaborate music videos that I made with my friends. I started my own Youtube channel where I gained a small, but supportive following. Throughout my life, I've always loved doing activities that involved creating, producing, then publishing. 
		<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I have carried my passion for design and innovation into Tufts University with me as I enter my second semester of my freshman year. I am currently enrolled in the engineering school where I plan to double major in Computer Science and Human Factors.
